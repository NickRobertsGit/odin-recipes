    <p>I'm here to tell you that instant ramen doesn't have to be just a means to an end when your wallet is feeling a bit light. There's a couple ways of really spicing up your bowl of noodles without breaking the bank!</p>
    <p><strong>Let's get into it:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil up 2 cups of water in a small saucepan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Then, drop your noodles in for about 2-3 minutes, until they become soft and.. noodle..-like? Then add your spice packet (my go-to is "Creamy Chicken").</li>
        <br>
        <li>With the water still boiling, slowly crack an egg and drop the egg into the boiling water (you're going to cook this for about 2-3 additional minutes).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Immediately cover the saucepan with a lid.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, in your eating bowl prepare by adding a sprinkle of sesame seeds and a splash of teriyaki sauce.</li>
        <br>
        <li>After your egg is done poaching, remove the saucepan from the heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Carefully pour your ramen noodles and broth into your eating bowl, add a small amount of butter and half a slice of american cheese ontop of the noodles to melt.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>BAM,</strong> you've got yourself a DELICIOUS bowl of instant ramen noodles.</li>
    </ol>
