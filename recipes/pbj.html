    <p>First off, don't discount the peanut butter and jelly as a meal. It's <strong>100%</strong> a legit meal! The peanut butter gives you some protein and fat, the jelly gives you some sugar and sweetness, and the bread gives you... <em> uhhhh</em>... fiber?</p>
    <p><strong>With that disclaimer out of the way. Let's get into it:</strong></p>
    <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>Jelly</li>
        <li>2 Slice of Bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>PREPERATION</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>First off, you're going to want to grab two slice of bread (white bread specifically, if you're not a psycho), and place them on a plate, or maybe a paper towel, if you're cheap like me.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Then, you're going to spread a good amount of peanut butter (specifically <em>crunchy</em> if you're cool) across one of the slices of bread</li>
        <br>
        <li>Grab the other slice of bread and spread an even amount of jelly across it (I <em>personally</em> use strawberry preserves, but hey, whatever floats your boat!)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Smack those bad boys together and <strong>VOILA! </strong>You've got yourself an old-fashioned, American PB&J.</li>
    </ol>
